Getting started with nvForest
#############################

Installation
============
You can install nvForest using Pip or Conda.

.. code-block:: console

   # Using Pip: need a suffix corresponding to your CUDA version, e.g. for CUDA 13:
   $ pip install nvforest-cu13

.. code-block:: console

   # Using Conda: need to specify the rapidsai channel
   $ conda install -c rapidsai -c conda-forge nvforest

You can also install nvForest as part of RAPIDS, a collection of libraries for GPU accelerated data science.
Visit https://docs.rapids.ai/install/ for more information.

nvForest with Python
====================

.. testsetup:: workflow

    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

    X = np.array([[1, 2], [-1, 2]], dtype="float32")
    y = np.array([0, 1], dtype="int32")

    skl_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=1, max_depth=1)
    skl_model.fit(X, y)

First example
-------------

To run inference for decision tree models, it takes only two lines of code:

.. testcode:: workflow

    import nvforest

    # model_dir: pathlib.Path object, pointing to a directory containing model files.
    fm = nvforest.load_model(model_dir / "xgboost_model.json")
    y = fm.predict(X)

Let us now look into all available options for nvForest.

Model import and device selection
---------------------------------

With nvForest, you can run tree models using CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs.
You may explicitly select which device to use by specifying the ``device`` parameter
in :py:meth:`~nvforest.load_model`. If no ``device`` is given, it is set to ``"auto"``.
(See the note below for the behavior of ``"auto"``.)

.. testcode:: workflow

    # Load XGBoost JSON model, to run inference on CPU
    fm = nvforest.load_model(model_dir / "xgboost_model.json", device="cpu")

    # Load LightGBM model, to run inference on GPU
    fm = nvforest.load_model(model_dir / "lightgbm_model.txt", device="gpu")

    # Load scikit-learn random forest, to run inference on GPU
    fm = nvforest.load_from_sklearn(skl_model, device="gpu")

.. note:: Automatically detecting ``device``

    Setting ``device="auto"`` in :py:meth:`~nvforest.load_model` will load the tree model
    onto GPU memory, if a GPU is available. If no GPU is available, the tree model will be
    loaded to the main memory instead. If no ``device`` parameter is specified, ``device="auto"``
    will be used.

    This feature allows you to use a single script to deploy tree models to heterogeneous array
    of machines, some with NVIDIA GPUs and some without.

.. note:: Automatically detecting ``model_type``

    By default, nvForest will attempt to detect the type of the model file using the file
    extension:

    * ``.json``: XGBoost JSON
    * ``.ubj``: XGBoost UBJSON
    * ``.txt``: LightGBM
    * Other: Treelite checkpoint (produced with :py:meth:`treelite.Model.serialize`)

    In cases where nvForest fails to detect the right model type, you may want to
    specify the ``model_type`` explicitly:

    .. testcode:: workflow

        fm = nvforest.load_model(model_dir / "lightgbm_model.txt", device="gpu",
                                 model_type="lightgbm")

The ``fm`` object will be one of the following types:

* :py:class:`~nvforest.GPUForestInferenceClassifier`: a classification model, to run on GPU.
  The model will reside in the GPU memory.
* :py:class:`~nvforest.GPUForestInferenceRegressor`: a regression model, to run on GPU.
  The model will reside in the GPU memory.
* :py:class:`~nvforest.CPUForestInferenceClassifier`: a classification model, to run on CPU.
  The model object will reside in the main memory.
* :py:class:`~nvforest.CPUForestInferenceRegressor`: a regression model, to run on CPU.
  The model object will reside in the main memory.

You can inspect the type of the model by printing its type:

.. doctest:: workflow

    >>> print(type(fm).__name__)
    GPUForestInferenceClassifier

.. note:: Selecting among multiple GPUs

    If your system has more than one NVIDIA GPU, you can select one of them to run tree inference
    by passing ``device_id`` parameter.

    .. code-block:: python

        # Load model to GPU device 1
        fm = nvforest.load_model(model_dir / "xgboost_model.json",
                                 device="gpu", device_id=1)
        fm = nvforest.load_from_sklearn(skl_model, device="gpu", device_id=1)

    Each model object is associated with a single device. Use the ``device_id`` property to look up
    which device the model object is located on.

Running inference
-----------------

After importing the model, run inference using :py:meth:`~nvforest.GPUForestInferenceRegressor.predict`
or its variants.

.. testcode:: workflow

    # Run inference
    pred = fm.predict(X)

    # Run inference and output class probabilities
    # Only applicable for classification models
    class_probs = fm.predict_proba(X)

    # Run inference and obtain leaf indices in each decision tree
    leaf_ids = fm.apply(X)

    # Run inference and obtain prediction per individual tree
    pred_per_tree = fm.predict_per_tree(X)

.. testcode:: workflow
    :hide:

    assert pred.shape == (X.shape[0], 1)
    assert class_probs.shape == (X.shape[0], fm.num_outputs)
    assert leaf_ids.shape == (X.shape[0], fm.num_trees)
    assert pred_per_tree.shape == (X.shape[0], fm.num_trees)

Auto-optimization
-----------------

Forest inference capabilities in nvForest allow users to fine-tune performance with a variety of hyperparameters.
It is impossible to predict what the optimal values will be for any given model and batch size, so it is
necessary to determine them empirically. nvForest significantly simplifies this process with a built-in method for
auto-optimization at any given batch size:

.. testcode:: workflow

    fm_optimized = fm.optimize(batch_size=1000)

The :py:meth:`~nvforest.GPUForestInferenceRegressor.optimize` returns a new instance of ``ForestInference``, and
subsequent prediction calls will use the optimal performance hyperparameters found for the indicated batch size.
You can also check what hyperparameters were selected by looking at the attributes.

.. testcode:: workflow

    # Optimal layout
    fm_optimized.layout
    # Optimal chunk size
    fm_optimized.default_chunk_size

nvForest with C++ (Advanced)
============================

Integrating your C++ application with nvForest
----------------------------------------------
nvForest provides a CMake config file so that other C++ projects can find and use it.

.. code-block:: cmake

    find_package(nvforest CONFIG REQUIRED)

    target_link_libraries(my_target PRIVATE nvforest::nvforest treelite::treelite)

To ensure that CMake can locate nvForest and Treelite, we recommend the use of Conda to install nvForest.

How to load tree models and run inference
-----------------------------------------

To import tree models into nvForest, first load the tree models as a Treelite model object.

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <treelite/model_loader.h>
    #include <treelite/tree.h>
    #include <memory>

    std::unique_ptr<treelite::Model> treelite_model
        = treelite::model_loader::LoadXGBoostModelUBJSON(
            "/path/to/xgboost_model.ubj", "{}");

Refer to `the Treelite documentation <https://treelite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for
the full list of model loader utilities.

Once the tree model is available as a Treelite object, pass it to the
:cpp:func:`~nvforest::import_from_treelite_model` to load it into nvForest.

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <nvforest/constants.hpp>
    #include <nvforest/device_type.hpp>
    #include <nvforest/treelite_importer.hpp>
    #include <nvforest/detail/index_type.hpp>
    #include <optional>

    auto fm = nvforest::import_from_treelite_model(
        *treelite_model,
        nvforest::preferred_tree_layout,
        nvforest::index_type{},
        std::nullopt,
        nvforest::device_type::gpu);

Now that the tree model is fully imported into nvForest, let's run inference:

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <raft/core/handle.hpp>
    #include <nvforest/handle.hpp>

    raft::handle_t raft_handle{};
    nvforest::handle_t handle{raft_handle};

    // Assumption:
    // * Both output and input are in the GPU memory.
    // * The input buffer should be of dimension (num_rows, num_features)
    // * The output buffer should be of dimension (num_rows, fm.num_outputs())
    fm.predict(handle, output, input, num_rows,
               nvforest::device_type::gpu, nvforest::device_type::gpu,
               nvforest::infer_kind::default_kind);
